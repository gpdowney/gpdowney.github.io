title: About Graham
---

hi, I'm Graham!

## Now

I live on Dena'ina e≈Çnena in Anchorage, Alaska.

I am the Economic Justice Lead with [AKPIRG](https://akpirg.org). I work on debt and housing policy.

I created and maintain [*the lightweight LSAT*](https://lightweightlsat.com), a completely free guide to the Law School Admissions test.

I'm a member of Anchorage's Finest Bike Polo Club.

## Before

I grew up inside the Beltway, just outside Washington, D.C. in Falls Church, Virginia.

In 2011, I graduated from Virginia Tech, Summa Cum Laude, with a major in Political Science, and minors in both Philosophy and Math. My undergraduate thesis was on "Food and Alienation."

While studying food academically, I also learned to cook by working at a local restaurant. When I started cooking, I didn't know how to boil water in the microwave, which demonstrates either my reckless arrogance or love of learning.

From 2011-2013, I was part of the first cohort of FoodCorps. I built school gardens and taught nutrition classes at 5 elementary schools in Jackson, Mississippi. I was once honored as the [Jacksonian of the Week](https://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2012/jun/27/graham-downey/).

In addition to gardening and teaching, I learned to love bicycling in Mississippi. While in Jackson, I helped lead advocacy rides, start a community repair co-op, and began playing bike polo.

In 2016, I graduated from Yale Law School. While there, I co-founded the Yale Food Law Society. Our efforts were written up [here](https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/news/farm-fork-landfill-yale-law-school-debuts-food-law-and-policy-course) and [here](https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/news/passion-food-law-grows-yale-law-school).

From 2016-2017, I was the Visiting Legal Scholar at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In this role, I helped lead the *Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food* Taskforce.

For the second half of 2017, disillusioned by politics, I road-tripped around the U.S. Over 6 months, I made it to 34 states, crashed on dozens of couches, and slept under the stars too many times to count.

When I returned to D.C., I worked as a barista, [volunteered at my yoga studio](https://www.flowyogacenter.com/blog/2018/9/20/karma-yogi-spotlight-graham-downey), almost founded a non-profit focused on building political power at the dinner table, started writing a newsletter, hosted weekly frambly (friends + family) dinners, and began teaching the LSAT.

From 2018-2021, I taught the LSAT with Manhattan Prep in DC and on Zoom.

From 2021-2022, I hosted Sidetracked on KRUA 88.1 FM as DJ Siesta. It was a show where we listened to my favorite albums.

From 2021-2023, I served on the board of [Bike Anchorage](https://www.bikeanchorage.org/).
