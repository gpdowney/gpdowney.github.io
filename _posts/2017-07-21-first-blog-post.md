Today I am two weeks into a several months trip in the West. By virtue of the solitude of airplanes and weekdays without work, I've spent quite a bit of my time reflecting. To help channel those reflections into more interesting thoughts, to hold myself accountable for writing more, and to keep y'all up to date with my travels, I decided to start this blog.

Stay tuned for stories, itineraries, lists, little thoughts, longer essays, photographs, recipes, and recommendations.

Here's me with a sign someone erected in my honor (apparently) in Venice Beach, Los Angeles, CA.

love,

Graham
