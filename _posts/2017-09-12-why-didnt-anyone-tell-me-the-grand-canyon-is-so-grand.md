It's really worth the hype. Pictures do it no justice. But here are some pictures anyways.

The North Rim was especially beautiful. Did a quick hike in the park and then retreated into the Kaibab National Forest for free camping (all the park sites fill up 13 months in advance) far away from all the crowds.

(The view from our campsite at Saddle Mountain before all the wind and rain rolled in. For this view, take forest road 611 to 610 for about a dozen miles.)

(Just another normal morning hike.)
