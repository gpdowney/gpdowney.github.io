Maybe it was the quarter tab of acid, but Joshua Tree was the most playful-feeling stop of the trip. I was a little worried on my drive over. The landscape was flat and grey, repeating the same barren desert for hundreds of miles. And it's not a park of stunning vistas or grueling hikes, rather it's a park of funny rock clumps and silly cacti/tree hybrids, which are home to big-eared rabbits and chirpy birds.

I spent the day toodle-dooin' my way down the park road on bike, frequently stopping to wander down a side trail or hop around on the rocks. In my slightly altered state, I pondered some mild insights, like how wise people often seem defined by their lack of hurry. Perhaps wisdom requires and even produces slowness? Yet I am often in a hurry. So I tried walking even slower, which was fun, but I'm not sure if it made me any wiser.
