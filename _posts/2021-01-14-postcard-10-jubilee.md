Here she is! My new love, Jubilee:

A jubilee is a party and a fresh start. Circa 444 BC, the Prophet Nehemiah established the Law of Jubilee, an every seventh year forgiveness of all (non-commercial) debts. Such periodic forgiveness, David Graeber hypothesized, is essential to the stability of any society based on debt, including both Ancient Babylon and the US since 1971. But my Jubilee is really just a 10-week-old, sweet lil floof. (More pictures available upon request.)

I'm settled in Anchorage for at least the next 3 years, so no more postcards for now. Though more newsletters to come, I hope. And I hope you'll visit, but I know I am very far away from most of you. So, in the meantime, I'd like to host a reading group and a writing group. Let me know if you'd like to be part of either!
