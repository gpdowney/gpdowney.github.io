1. An older couple who drove separate cars. Maybe it's an illicit rendezvous; he's "fishing" and she's "at her sister's." Or maybe they both don't like how the other drives. Or they have inconvenient work schedules.
2. A gaggle of preteen boys on very small skateboards.
3. One of those round black Weber stoves all ablaze, the heat sending visible waves through the air.
4. An older teenage couple. He on a longboard, she holding his hand/pulling him along
5. My very sandy, very dirty feet.
6. A middle-aged couple, one of the few without kids, consulting a map at their picnic table. An old Pepsi bottle refilled with water (or maybe empty). The back of their camper trailer meticulously cabineted.
7. My dishes, somehow harder to get up to clean when there's plenty of water on tap than when I had to filter my water from a stream.
8. A classic father-son duo. Son with braces, bareheaded, explaining something. Both with matching red shirts and khaki shorts. Father wearing a blue baseball cap with that pull-cinch at the back and shin-high socks in some kind of robust sandal.
9. A jet black bird with bright blue tail feathers shitting on the aforementioned older couple's carefully laid out tablecloth.
10. A young, very high, woman on the way to the beach asking if the sun had set yet and then whispering "Yessss" when I say it hasn't.
11. The half-moon. Over the dark and also light green hill. In the pale blue sky with a touch of purpleÂ fading to yellow over the setting sun.
12. A really really fat, long, hound-like dog.
