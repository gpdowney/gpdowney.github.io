Highlights of New Mexico were as follows:

- Avoiding the interstate, driving a leisurely 55mph on empty roads across blond plains between lumpy mountains and then a swoopy 35mph up those mountains.
- The Gila hot springs campground, but not it's 16F mornings.
- The surprisingly meaningful and impressive 800 year old Gila Cliff Dwellings.
- Walking barefoot on the dunes at White Sands at sunset, and even spotting a camel.
- Pushing my endurance and skill on two very rocky and steep mountain bike rides.
- The Lundeen Inn of the Arts in Las Cruces, where I absorbed the good vibes of the Georgia O'Keefe room and did not, to my friendly host's surprise, notice the lack of a bidet.
