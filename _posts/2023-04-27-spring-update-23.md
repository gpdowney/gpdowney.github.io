Friends,

I’ve been neglecting this newsletter, but don’t worry I’ve got lots of warm takes stored up for ya! I’m hoping to send y’all notes more regularly again.

First, a life update!

Winter is my favorite season in Alaska, in no small part because of the skiing, both nordic and alpine. Jubilee the dog and I are mourning the melt.

Since I last emailed you, I…

- learned JavaScript (sorta);
- organized a successful effort to [eliminate parking minimums](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2022/11/24/anchorage-eliminates-minimum-parking-requirements-for-new-developments-adds-bike-parking-rules/) in Anchorage;
- installed a toilet all on my own;
- wrote a bill to [make 36% the maximum interest rate](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/33?Root=HB%20145) in Alaska; and
- bought a house with Aneliese.

Our home is a cutie log cabin close to the trails with 2 guest rooms waiting just for you.

## Reading Notes: Public Citizens

I haven’t been writing here, but I have been writing. Particularly reading notes. I thought, perhaps, you might be interested in some of those notes?

[Here’s a link to my thoughts about Public Citizens by Paul Sabin (2022)]({% post_url 2023-04-27-public-citizens %}).
The gist of the book is: Ralph Nader and the public interest movement have undermined good government.

You might enjoy reading the notes if…

    you’ve ever said the phrase “non-profit-industrial-complex;”
    you want to understand why the environmental movement can’t seem to win; or
    you worry about the decline of social capital.

The notes are a mix of my ideas and Sabin’s, and they’re a bit long. If you read them, I’d to hear what you think!
