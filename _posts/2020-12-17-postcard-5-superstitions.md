It was rainy in the desert, which was not what I had signed up for! But on further reflection actually rain in the desert is a rare treat and, truly, I'm happy for the cacti, &c. The rain, and a late arrival thanks to successfully avoiding the interstate again, had me sleeping in the prius for the first time. It wasn't the most comfortable, but it was roomy enough for me to maintain my feeling of moral and strategic superiority to the surrounding RVers.

In the morning, I drove 10 minutes for starbucks, which is camp cheating, yes, but also a useful way to start my day faster. Historically, I've been a fan of lingering at camp in the morning: sleeping in, enjoying coffee, eating oatmeal very slowly because it's not actually that tasty, maybe writing a little. But this trip, I've become a get-up-and-go convert. Limited winter daylight is a useful motivator; and 5:30pm sunsets, cold nights, plus a lack of wifi have me asleep by 8p anyways.

After caffeinating and then restocking on canned and bagged foods (refried beans, goldfish, la croix, gummy worms, &c.) at a surprisingly mask-compliant walmart, I returned to camp and found the Superstitions looking especially spooky. Supposedly, they are inhabited by evil spirits; and I'm sure it was just the wind, but I definitely heard them crying out while I hiked up.
