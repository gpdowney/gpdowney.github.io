Some happenings since I last wrote you...

*Sidetracked* has moved to Saturdays at 1p AKT on 88.1FM Anchorage or <https://KRUAradio.org>. You can also [listen to archived shows here](/blog_types/radio/).

I (re)learned to code and self-published a free guide to the LSAT. You can find it at <https://lightweightlsat.com>. The site is still a work in progress, both in terms of content and design. I'd welcome your feedback.

Winter is my new favorite season. Turns out that winter is better when it's colder. When it stays cold, you can get used to the cold. And the snow sticks around instead of thawing-freezing into slush and ice.

- Winter highlight: learning to skate ski.
- Winter lowlight: grumpy moose on the trails.

I have a new gig! I'm now the Consumer Advocate with [AKPIRG](https://www.akpirg.org). Currently I'm working on payday lending, debt collections, zoning reform, and land back.

- Work lowlight: In Alaska, the average payday loan is for $500 and takes 4 months to repay. Over those 4 months, the average person will pay more than $1100 to clear their debt.
- Work highlight: The [TV news interviewed me](https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2022/04/28/report-alaskans-medical-debt-collections-nearly-double-national-amount/) last week. After it aired, someone emailed AKPIRG to ask for help with an overwhelming debt. We had a 45 minute call where I mostly listened and apologized for having only generic advice. But then, the very next day, they called me back with amazing news: just asking for an itemized bill had cut their debt *in half*. More than $5,000 of their debt had been for a bogus charge. That call may have been the most helpful way I've ever spent 45 minutes.

Jubilee the Dog remains a certified cutie.
