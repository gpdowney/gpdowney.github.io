Dearest Friends,

I've left DC. I'm moving to Alaska.

For the next few issues, I'm just going to send you little postcards from the road.

My first stop on the way to Alaska was obviously Florida. Aneliese P. and I spent Thanksgiving with loyal newsletter readers Kate D. and Brian D. (aka my folks). The Thanksgiving Ham was large, and the sides--spinach bush, cornbread, and beans--delicious as always. The weather was peak Florida for the first few days, 80F and sunny, so we obviously went to the beach, and for the first time in my life I voluntarily put on sunscreen. This did, however, set back my attempts to acclimatize to colder weather.

St. Augustine Fun Fact: Spanish St. Augustine was a relative safe haven for runaway slaves and radicals, and a thorn in the side of the (former) British Colonies. And, later, a haven for hucksters, like Ripley of Believe it or Not.
