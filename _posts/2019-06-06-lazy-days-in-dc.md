title: A Guide to Lazy Days in DC
tag: blog
---

At first glance, DC is built to serve tourists and yuppies. This makes the city appear [very boring][1] and very busy. But it also means DC is full of nice places that mostly go underused. Consider my favorite: Big Bear. The line is hellish on weekend mornings, but during the workday the patio is heavenly. By inverting the patterns of the conformists, by going, for example, to the great brunch spot at any time other than brunch, you can make the city yours.

So here’s a guide for enjoying that lazier (inverted) side of DC. This was made with your help - thanks especially to Ross B, Brian C, Jade C, James FT, Julian G, Brian H, Katie L, Kate D, Aneliese P, Dan S, and Alias T! As always, if you have additions or complaints, send me a note.

And if you’re a more visual person, I also made a map.

> *(archivists note: the map has been lost to time.)*

## Recommended gear

* Fannypack
* Snacks
* Water
* Books + pen + paper
* A bicycle. If you don’t own one, capital bikeshare is cheap.
* Leave your phone at home. Instead: arrange to meet people in advance; write down addresses and rough directions in advance; get lost and found.

## Get caffeinated

* Best option: the patio at big bear.
* Good alternatives: a baked joint, elle, colony club, and zeke’s.

## Go for a Ride or Walk

* Get into Rock Creek Park! I love trying to find a new entrance and trying to get lost. Julian G. says “you can find trail heads throughout Mount Pleasant and there's an entire network of veins throughout the woods!” Also suggested: the capitol stones, biking on beach drive (it’s closed to cars on weekends), or stopping for a picnic at one of the creekside sites.
* Dan S walks [this walk][4] some weekend mornings: “I like it because you only cross the street a handful of times, can walk for a long time, and are surrounded by trees. It's also mostly bike unfriendly.”
* Kenilworth gardens when the lotuses bloom is pretty magical. This pairs well with a bike ride on the Anacostia Tributary Trail System.
* Brian C suggests a way to stay close to home but still push your comfort zone: “Walk mindfully and barefoot while picking up trash through your neighborhood”
* Go to the Arboretum! Check out the bonsais and redwoods and capital columns!
* Get confused on the roads around the Wharf/Jefferson Memorial/Cherry Blossoms. Read some quotes from TJ and end up on Hains Point where you can minigolf or do bike loops with the spandex crowd. Or cross the river again and ride through Lady Bird Johnson park (Katie L. says the boardwalks feel jungle-y).
* Cross the Key Bridge into the wilds of Virginia:
  * Take a left to watch the planes land over Gravelly Point.
  * Two quick lefts will take you out onto the somewhat spooky Roosevelt Island.
  * Or take a right to for a longer bike ride towards Arlington and Falls Church.
  * Stop at the Italian Store, right off the trail before the loop-de-loop for lunch.
  * If you want to go a bit further, hit up [Eden Center][5], a bit off trail from East Falls Church. Brian H and I went to Padaek, an excellent Lao across the highway.

## Lunch in the city

* Lil’ Sesame downtown after or before the bidness crowd
* Pick up a half loaf of bread at Seylou, pair with some cheese and fruit for a full meal
* A Litteri in Union Market for v tasty sammies
* Grab picnic fixings at Trader Joe’s on 14th and hit up Malcolm X Park. It’s especially lively on Sundays thanks to the drum circle.

## Find a shady spot to read or rest

* Check out an [ebook from the DC Public Library][6]
* Crispus Attucks. Katie L. says “there’s a journal in the bench there that can have some nice thoughts.”
* Spanish Steps in Kalorama
* Stairs on the Potomac near Memorial Bridge
* Dumbarton Oaks

## Or, if it’s rainy or cold or you just want to be inside

* The orchid room in the botanical gardens
* Tour of the Freemason temple on 16th st
* Spa World for 4 hours, minimum.
* Check out one of the many free museums
  * My fav: Hirshhorn
  * Portrait Gallery is open a bit later in the evening than the other museums. I love the courtyard and Katie L recommends the 3rd Floor.
  * The Renwick is also p neat.
  * Zoo lights for a chance to see the animals out at night
* Dan S. would also like to plug the Second Story Books warehouse in Rockville (right by the Metro). It's a giant, messy, cheap used bookstore.

## Stretch your body out

* Pretend to be a potential client at Vida and go to a class / get a workout for free, including mat/towel/sauna/shower.
* Pretend to be a new client at a Core Power yoga for a free week of classes.
* Get the $25 for two weeks intro pass at Flow and join me for a bunch of classes. (If you live here, apply to be a karma yogi and take unlimited classes with me in exchange for 2ish hours a week of work.)
* Past Tense Yoga offers free classes when taught by a teacher-in-training
* There’s free zouk dance sessions on the Georgetown waterfront sundays at 3pm
* Rent a kayak or paddle board under the Key Bridge in Georgetown

## Make dinner at home, come over to my house (seriously), or enjoy DC’s decent restaurants

* My favs for Ramen: Haikan, Daikaya, or Toki Underground.
* My fav for ethiopian: the veggie combo platter to share at Habesha.
* James FT always has the best food recommendations and he recommends: bombay street food, timber pizza, bantam king, panda gourmet, chercher, tiger fork, and little Havana

## Night lyfe

* Ride out the C&O Canal, camp at Marsden Tract or at Mile 16 or any of the many campsites all the way to Pittsburg
* Bike down Pennsylvania Ave or the Mall after dark / before or after a free show at the Kennedy Center’s Millennium Stage or a picnic on the Georgetown waterfront.
* Sneak into a cemetary
* Sneak into a luxury building’s rooftop pool.
* Catch a show with the good folks of Hamlin Street Diner ([facebook][7])
* Ice Cream: Jeni’s on 14th St is my go to. Jade C also likes Mount Desert Island Ice Cream.
* Here are some places James FT told me are good to drink at: Red Derby, Lyman’s, Showtime, and Right Proper
* Katie L. suggests the tour and tasting at Green Hat gin distillery and thinks if you get a group together they may even let you bottle.
Other resources...
* My map was inspired by James FT who made [this even more comprehensive map of recommendations][8] in DC and Arlington for a recent bike polo tournament.
* [730 DC][9] is a very good nearly daily newsletter with the best happenings
* For more ideas: Washington City Paper recently put out their [2019 guide to the Best* of DC][10] (*ugh)
* This [bucket list][11] from WAMU has good ideas too.
